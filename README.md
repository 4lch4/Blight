# @4lch4/blight

Blight is a CLI application that allows you to easily manage a [Kuando Busylight][0] from your terminal by using the Busylight HTTP application.

## Requirements

In order for this app to work, you have to have the official Busylight HTTP app installed and running on your computer. Here are the two ways I'm aware of to get it:

1. From [the Development Tools section of the download software page][2]. You have to request it though.
2. From the same download software page linked just above, but under the Premium Software you want to download the one for Twilio. The zip provided will include the HTTP app.

## Usage

```bash
blight on green

blight off
```

## Further Reading

For more information, refer to [the manual][1] from Kuando on the HTTP app, it's where the API documentation resides.
